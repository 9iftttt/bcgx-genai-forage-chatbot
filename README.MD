## üöÄ Overview

- **Purpose:** Quickly access, compare, and analyze company financial metrics.
- **Technologies:** Python, Flask, Pandas, HTML/CSS (responsive, chat-style UI).
- **Data:** Reads from an updatable CSV file (`Task1_Summary-Finding.csv`).

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works

- Loads financial data from a CSV file.
- Uses rule-based logic to interpret queries (company, year, metric).
- Retrieves and displays relevant data using Pandas.
- Maintains chat history (per session) in a clean, chat-bubble format.
- Fully responsive design and finance-themed color palette.

## üí° Supported Queries

The chatbot answers questions about:

- **Financial Metrics:**
  - Revenue
  - Net Income
  - Total Assets
  - Total Liabilities
  - Cash Flow
  - Profit Margin (%)
- **Growth Comparisons:**
  - Revenue growth between two years
  - Net income growth between two years
- **Performance Checks:**
  - Revenue or net income decline in a specific year

**Example queries:**
- `What is Apple‚Äôs revenue in 2024?`
- `What was Microsoft‚Äôs net income growth from 2023 to 2024?`
- `Did Tesla‚Äôs revenue decline in 2023?`
- `What is Tesla‚Äôs profit margin in 2022?`

## üìù How to Update Data

- Edit or replace `Task1_Summary-Finding.csv` with new data (keep column names the same).
- Restart the chatbot. It will use the updated data automatically.

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Limitations

- **Rule-based:** Only understands queries matching its logic and keywords.
- **No fuzzy matching:** Typos, unusual phrasing, or unsupported metrics won‚Äôt be recognized.
- **Static data:** Does not fetch live/external data; limited to the CSV provided.
- **No context memory:** Does not support conversational follow-ups outside of the current question.
